What is DevOps?
DevOps is communucation methodology between developer and operation team. DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is a software development methodology and cultural shift that aims to bridge the gap between development teams (responsible for creating software) and operations teams (responsible for deploying and managing software in production). It promotes collaboration, communication, and integration between these traditionally siloed functions to improve the efficiency, reliability, and quality of software delivery.
